# Legends of Runeterra History Tracker

This idea initially started as a simple win tracker twitch overlay for Legends of Runeterra. It has since expanded to be a history tracker (which can also be used to track wins in the future!) and combines multiple LoR Client APIs in order to accomplish this. 

## Main tools/frameworks
In order to make all of this happen, I am using the following tools/frameworks:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
   - via [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/)
- [AWS DynamoDb](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

## Getting Started

This repository isn't really meant for others to use, I'm mostly providing it here for visibility purposes.

You won't be able to clone/fork this repo and get it started without certain secrets (which you could infer from the code and create your own if you really wanted to :shrug:)
